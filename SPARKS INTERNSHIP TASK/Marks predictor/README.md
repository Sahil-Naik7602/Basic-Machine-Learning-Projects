# Marks Predictor

Under the The Sparks Foundation's GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program) I managed to do this basic ML deployment on predicting the marks secured by any fellow as per the number of hours he/she study. I used Linear Regression for this and deployed this model on an website whose link is below using StreamLit, so that anyone can use it very easily.
