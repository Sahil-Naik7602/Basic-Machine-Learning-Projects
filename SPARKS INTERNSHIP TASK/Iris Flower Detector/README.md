# Iris Flower Classifier

Under the The Sparks Foundation's GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program) I managed to do this basic ML deployment on classifying and predicting different species of Iris Flower on the basis of it's Sepal Length, Sepal Width ,Petal Length and Petal Width. I used Decision tree Classifier algorithm for this and deployed this model on an website whose link is below using StreamLit, so that anyone can use it very easily.
